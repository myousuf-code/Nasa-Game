# NASA Data Integration in Farm Navigator

This document explains how NASA data is integrated into the Farm Navigator game.

## NASA Data Sources

1. **NASA POWER API**: Climate data including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed.
2. **Earth Imagery API**: Satellite imagery for the farm locations.
3. **Soil Data**: Soil quality and composition data (simulated in the current version).

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. Raw data is fetched using the modules in `src/data_processing/nasa_data.py`
2. Data is processed and converted to game-usable formats in `src/data_processing/data_processor.py`
3. The game engine in `src/game/core.py` uses this processed data to influence game mechanics

## Educational Aspects

The game demonstrates how NASA data can be used in agricultural applications:

1. **Climate Data**: Players learn how temperature and precipitation affect crop growth
2. **Satellite Imagery**: Shows vegetation health and land use patterns
3. **Soil Data**: Demonstrates the relationship between soil quality and crop yields

## Extending the Data Integration

To add more NASA data sources:

1. Add new API access functions in `nasa_data.py`
2. Create processing functions in `data_processor.py`
3. Integrate the processed data into game mechanics in `core.py`

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time data fetching based on player's chosen location
- Historical data for comparisons over time
- More advanced climate models using multiple NASA data sources
- Visualizations showing how NASA data is being applied

## Data Limitations

The current version uses some simulated data due to API access limitations. In a full implementation, proper NASA API credentials would be used to access complete datasets.
